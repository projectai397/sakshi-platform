# Sakshi Oasis - India's First Technology Disconnection Sanctuary

## Executive Summary

Inspired by Museum of the Future's Al Waha in Dubai, but deeply rooted in **Indian healing traditions** (Ayurveda, Yoga, Vedic wisdom), Sakshi Oasis combines ancient practices with cutting-edge technology to create transformative experiences.

Unlike Al Waha's 5 therapies, Sakshi Oasis offers **12 unique experiences** across 5,000+ sq ft, with **triple pricing** for universal access, **AI-personalized journeys**, and **complete biometric tracking** for measurable outcomes.
