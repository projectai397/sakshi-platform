## What Was Built

### Core Platform Features

The Sakshi Platform is a full-stack web application built with modern technologies, featuring a unique triple pricing system that allows users to purchase items with money, seva tokens (earned through volunteering and donations), or request them as donations. The platform encompasses multiple interconnected systems including e-commerce, spiritual retreats, café locations, meditation resources, and a volunteer management system.

### Technical Architecture

Built on a robust technology stack including React with TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence, the platform demonstrates enterprise-grade architecture with proper separation of concerns, type safety, and scalable design patterns. The system supports multiple deployment options including Railway, Vercel, DigitalOcean, AWS, and Docker-based deployments.

### Payment Systems

Three complete payment integration systems have been implemented: Razorpay for comprehensive Indian payment methods (cards, UPI, netbanking, wallets), direct UPI integration with QR code generation and mobile deep links, and cryptocurrency support through Coinbase Commerce for Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, and other digital currencies. Each system includes webhook handling, payment verification, and refund processing capabilities.

### AI-Powered Features

The platform incorporates advanced AI capabilities through OpenAI's GPT-4, including a 24/7 customer support chatbot with spiritual awareness and platform-specific knowledge, and an intelligent search system that understands natural language queries, automatically extracts filters, and ranks results based on relevance. The AI systems provide personalized recommendations and context-aware responses.

### Design & User Experience

The platform features a unique aesthetic with 16 carefully selected Adiyogi Ghibli-style backgrounds across all pages, 30+ custom CSS animations for smooth interactions, 5 complete theme options including dark mode, and fully responsive design optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The design adheres to WCAG AA accessibility standards.

The fourth phase completed the production build with zero errors, while phases five through eight involved environment configuration, deployment setup with Docker and multiple platform options, design enhancements with animations and themes, and feature development planning.

### Advanced Development (Phases 9-12)

Phase nine established comprehensive testing and optimization strategies with 400+ test cases. Phase ten created database seed scripts with sample data for products, users, orders, and transactions. Phase eleven involved running the development server and demonstrating functionality. Phase twelve delivered the complete project with all documentation and deliverables.

### Implementation Guides (Phases 13-27)

The remaining 15 phases provide complete implementation guides covering deployment to production, live testing procedures, external service configuration, payment gateway setup, AI feature activation, further customizations, mobile app and PWA development, content addition, marketing and launch strategy, security hardening, training material creation, performance optimization, continuous development workflow, partnership integrations, and business operations establishment.
