@dev Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.\n Contracts that want to implement ERC-165 should inherit from this contract and override {supportsInterface} to check\n for the additional interface id that will be supported. For example:\n ```solidity\n function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool) {\n     return interfaceId == type(MyInterface).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);\n }\n

WARNING: Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-721 or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
