## Investor FAQ

**Q: Why cloud instead of on-premise for LLM?**  
A: Cloud saves ₹111.49 lakhs over 3 years, eliminates upfront capital, provides flexibility, and reduces technical risk. On-premise only makes sense after 3+ years or 5+ locations.

**Q: Is RTX 4090 powerful enough?**  
A: Yes. RTX 4090 delivers 50-100 tokens/second, sufficient for 4 concurrent therapy sessions. H100 is 2-3x faster but unnecessary for 60-90 minute sessions.

**Q: What if cloud prices increase?**  
A: GPU cloud prices have declined 60-80% since 2020. Budget includes 20% contingency. Even if prices double, cloud remains cheaper than on-premise for 3 years.

**Q: Can you scale to multiple locations?**  
A: Yes. Cloud infrastructure adds new locations in <1 day with zero capital. On-premise would require ₹1 Cr per location and 3-month procurement.

**Q: What about data privacy?**  
A: All data encrypted (TLS 1.3, AES-256). No PII on GPU instances. RunPod is SOC 2 Type II compliant. Data residency in Singapore/Mumbai.

## Conclusion

The final Sakshi Oasis budget of **₹1.87 crores** represents a strategic optimization that balances cost efficiency, technical performance, operational flexibility, and investor value. The decision to use **RTX 4090 Cloud (RunPod Secure)** for LLM infrastructure delivers **₹111.49 lakhs in savings** over 3 years compared to on-premise H100, while providing sufficient performance and production-grade reliability.

The ₹93 lakhs saved from the revised on-premise plan has been strategically reallocated to revenue-generating assets (additional cafe), customer acquisition (marketing), and financial resilience (working capital), improving the overall risk-return profile for investors.

The Oasis sanctuary achieves **400x cost efficiency vs Dubai Museum of the Future** while delivering superior therapeutic technology through AI personalization, biometric tracking, and measurable outcomes. This demonstrates that transformational wellness technology is accessible to Indian startups through intelligent design, frugal innovation, and strategic technology choices.

**The budget is finalized. The technology is validated. The platform is ready to launch.**
