**Based on:** Comprehensive Analysis and Budget Revision  
**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Status:** Critical Decision Point

---

## Executive Summary

The Sakshi Platform development is complete and production-ready. However, a critical budget revision reveals a **40% increase** (₹80.5 lakhs) in hardware costs due to LLM server underestimation. This document outlines the strategic path forward, addressing the budget gap and providing a clear roadmap to launch.

**Key Decision Required:** Choose between on-premise LLM server (₹1 crore CAPEX) or cloud-based GPU service (₹17-22 lakhs over 3 years OPEX).

## I. Immediate Actions (This Week)

### A. Critical Financial Decision

**Decision Point:** LLM Infrastructure Strategy

**Option 1: On-Premise Server** (Recommended for Scale)
- Investment: ₹1.00 crore upfront
- Revised seed funding: ₹10.8 crores for 20% equity
- 3-year TCO: ₹1.06 crores
- Best for: Long-term cost optimization, data privacy, low latency

**Option 2: Cloud-Based GPUaaS** (Recommended for Launch)
- Investment: ₹0 upfront, ₹5-7 lakhs/year OPEX
- Seed funding: ₹10 crores (unchanged)
