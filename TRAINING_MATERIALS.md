**If customer seems uncertain:**
"All three tiers are equally honored here. Choose what feels right for you today."

Response: "Great question! Our fair price of ₹120 covers the actual cost of organic ingredients and fair wages for farmers. We also offer a community price of ₹80 for those who need support, and a supporter price of ₹200 that helps subsidize community meals. Which feels right for you today?"

**Scenario: Customer wants to pay less than community price**

Response: "I understand. The community price is our lowest tier, but we also accept Seva tokens. You can earn tokens by bringing a reusable container, writing a review, or volunteering. Would you like to learn more about that?"
