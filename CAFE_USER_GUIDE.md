## Understanding Triple Pricing

### The Three Tiers

**💙 Community Tier (40% of fair price)**

This tier is for those who need financial support. We believe everyone deserves access to healthy, nourishing food regardless of their economic situation.

*Example: Sattvic Thali - ₹150*

**💚 Fair Tier (True cost)**

This tier covers the actual cost of ingredients, preparation, staff, and sustainable operations. Most customers choose this tier.

*Example: Sattvic Thali - ₹250*

**🧡 Supporter Tier (150% of fair price)**

This tier helps subsidize community tier access. By paying a bit more, you're helping others eat healthy too!

*Example: Sattvic Thali - ₹350*

### Choosing Your Tier

**How to decide:**

1. **Assess your situation** - Be honest about what you can afford
2. **No judgment** - All tiers receive the same quality and service
3. **Pay it forward** - If you can afford supporter tier, you're helping others
4. **Mix and match** - You can choose different tiers for different items

**Privacy guaranteed:**
- Your tier choice is never visible to staff or other customers
- All orders are prepared with equal care and attention
- No questions asked, no verification required
