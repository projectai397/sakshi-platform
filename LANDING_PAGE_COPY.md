### Community Stories

**Spotlight: Meera's Transformation**

When Meera first discovered Sakshi, she was struggling with health issues and a tight budget. The community pricing tier allowed her to access nutritious Satvic meals she couldn't otherwise afford. She started attending cooking classes, earning Seva tokens along the way. Six months later, Meera has lost 15 kg, reversed her pre-diabetes, and now volunteers at the cafe teaching others what she's learned. "Sakshi didn't just change my diet," she says. "It changed my entire life."

**Spotlight: The Repair Cafe Heroes**

Every Saturday, a dedicated group of volunteers gathers at our repair cafe to work their magic. Led by retired engineer Suresh and seamstress extraordinaire Lakshmi, they've repaired over 1,000 items in the past year—saving them from landfills and saving families hundreds of thousands of rupees. "It's not just about fixing things," Suresh explains. "It's about showing people that things can be fixed, that we don't have to live in a throwaway culture."

### Pricing Transparency

**How Triple Pricing Works**

We believe healthy food should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. That's why we created our triple pricing system—a dignified way to ensure universal access while maintaining sustainability.

**Community Tier**: Covers the cost of ingredients and basic operations. Choose this tier if money is tight or you're going through a difficult time. No proof required, no questions asked.

**Fair Tier**: Covers the full cost of the meal including ingredients, labor, rent, and operations. This is our suggested price and helps us maintain quality and sustainability.

**Supporter Tier**: Pays a bit extra to help subsidize community tier meals for others. If you're in a position to help, this is a beautiful way to support your neighbors.

The beauty of this system is that it balances out naturally. Some pay less, some pay more, and everyone eats well. It's community economics at its finest.

### FAQ Section

**What is Satvic food?**

Satvic food is based on ancient Ayurvedic principles and consists of pure, wholesome, plant-based ingredients that promote clarity, peace, and vitality. It excludes onion, garlic, and other tamasic (heavy) foods, focusing instead on fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dairy alternatives.

**How does the triple pricing work?**

Simply choose the tier that feels right for you when ordering. Community tier if you're on a budget, Fair tier to cover our costs, or Supporter tier to help others. There's no verification process—we trust you to choose honestly based on your circumstances.

**What are Seva tokens?**

Seva tokens are our community currency. You earn them by participating—attending classes, volunteering, sharing recipes, helping at events. Use them for discounts on meals, workshops, and more. One token equals one rupee in value.

**Do I need to be vegetarian to join?**

Not at all! While our food is 100% plant-based, we welcome everyone regardless of their dietary choices. Many of our members are on a journey toward plant-based eating, and we're here to support wherever you are on that path.

**Can I volunteer even if I have no special skills?**

Absolutely! We need all kinds of help—from serving food to organizing events, from social media to gardening. Your time and enthusiasm are valuable, and we'll find the perfect role for you.

**Is there a membership fee?**

No! Creating an account and joining our community is completely free. You only pay for what you order or the classes you attend, and even then, you choose your price tier.
