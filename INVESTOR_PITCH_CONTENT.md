**Heading:** India faces a triple crisis in food, health, and sustainability that affects 1.4 billion people

3. **Farmer Crisis:** 86% of farmers earn less than ₹10,000/month despite feeding the nation, trapped in exploitative supply chains with 6-8 middlemen
4. **Environmental Crisis:** Food systems contribute 30% of India's carbon emissions, with industrial agriculture degrading 30% of cultivable land
5. **Affordability Barrier:** Healthy, organic food costs 2-3x conventional options, making conscious living a luxury only 5% can afford
