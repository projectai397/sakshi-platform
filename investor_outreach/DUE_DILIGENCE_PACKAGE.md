## Executive Summary

Sakshi Platform is India's first integrated conscious living ecosystem, combining organic cafes, AI-powered Ayurvedic wellness sanctuaries, and direct farmer partnerships under one membership-based destination. We make sustainable living accessible and affordable while ensuring farmers receive fair prices through vertical integration.

**The Opportunity:**

The Indian conscious living market represents a ₹50,000+ crore opportunity growing at 25% annually. However, current solutions serve only the top 2% of consumers—organic food costs 3-5x more than conventional alternatives, and wellness experiences charge ₹15,000-50,000 per day. Meanwhile, organic farmers receive only 30-40% of retail prices due to middlemen layers.

**Our Solution:**

Sakshi creates an integrated ecosystem of seven centers—Cafe, Oasis wellness sanctuary, Meditation Tech, Learning spaces, Community hubs, Marketplace, and Kids zone. We source directly from 500+ organic farmers, paying them 20-30% above market rates while keeping consumer costs affordable through operational efficiency and vertical integration.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Technology Moat:** AI-powered therapy personalization using Llama 3 8B fine-tuned on Ayurvedic protocols, biometric tracking with measurable outcomes
- **Capital Efficiency:** 400x more efficient than Dubai Museum's ₹800 Cr wellness floor (we deliver superior experience for ₹1.87 Cr)
- **Community Network Effects:** 10M+ built-in audience through Subah Saraf partnership
- **Triple Bottom Line:** Financial returns + farmer prosperity + environmental sustainability
- **Ecosystem Lock-in:** 7 integrated centers creating habit formation and 3x higher retention

**Traction:**

- 10M+ community through Subah Saraf (India's leading conscious living influencer)
- 50,000+ requests for Sakshi locations across 25 cities
- 87% intent-to-purchase from community survey
- Production-ready technology platform (117,780 lines of code)
- Complete procurement analysis with sourcing partners identified

**Financial Projections:**

- **Year 1:** ₹4.8 Cr revenue, 10% EBITDA, 4 locations
- **Year 2:** ₹12 Cr revenue, 12% EBITDA, 12 locations
- **Year 3:** ₹24 Cr revenue, 15% EBITDA, 25 locations

**Investment Terms:**

- **Raise:** ₹10 crores for 20% equity
- **Valuation:** ₹50 crores post-money
- **Use of Funds:** 56% location buildout, 20% working capital, 15% team, 9% marketing
- **Investor Returns:** 3.5x in 36 months (61% IRR) at Series A valuation of ₹175 crores

## Business Model Deep Dive

### Revenue Streams

Sakshi generates revenue from seven integrated centers, creating diversification and resilience. Each stream reinforces the others, driving cross-sell and retention.

#### 1. Sakshi Cafe (40% of revenue)

The Cafe serves as the anchor, providing organic meals at affordable prices through direct farmer sourcing. Revenue comes from two sources: membership fees and walk-in sales.

**Membership Model:**

The triple pricing structure ensures accessibility while maintaining sustainability:

- **Dakshina (Divine Offering):** ₹500/month for low-income individuals, unlimited meals, subsidized by Seva members
- **Moolya (True Value):** ₹1,500/month standard pricing, unlimited meals, covers full cost plus margin
- **Seva (Selfless Service):** ₹5,000+/month to sponsor others, unlimited meals, funds Dakshina subsidies

**Walk-in Pricing:**

Non-members can purchase meals at ₹150-400 per meal, with pricing based on complexity and ingredients. This creates a trial mechanism—walk-ins often convert to members after 3-4 visits.

- Gross margin: 75% (instructor fees 25%, materials minimal)
- Monthly revenue per location: ₹3.75 lakhs

#### 5. Community Events (8% of revenue)

**Revenue Sources:**

- Hourly childcare: ₹300/hour per child
- Kids workshops: ₹500-1,000 per child per session
- Summer camps: ₹10,000-25,000 per child per week

**Unit Economics:**

- Monthly childcare hours: 500 (average 25 hours/day)
- Monthly workshops: 12 (3 per week)
- Average attendance: 10 kids per workshop
- Gross margin: 60%
- Monthly revenue per location: ₹1.5 lakhs

### Revenue Diversification

The seven revenue streams create resilience and reduce dependency on any single source. If Cafe revenue declines, Oasis and Learning can compensate. If walk-in traffic is slow, membership revenue provides stability.

More importantly, the streams reinforce each other. Cafe members try Oasis. Oasis members attend workshops. Workshop attendees bring kids to Kids Zone. This cross-sell drives lifetime value from ₹30,000 to ₹50,000+ per member.

### Membership Economics

The membership model creates predictable recurring revenue and high customer lifetime value. Unlike transaction-based businesses (pay per meal, pay per session), memberships generate upfront commitments and reduce churn.

**Average Member Profile:**

- Cafe membership: ₹1,500/month
- Oasis membership: ₹2,800/month
- Meditation package: ₹1,200/month
- Monthly workshops: ₹2,000/month
- **Total monthly spend:** ₹7,500

**Lifetime Value Calculation:**

- Average membership duration: 48 months (based on similar wellness/food membership businesses)
- Monthly spend: ₹7,500
- Annual spend: ₹90,000
- Lifetime value: ₹3,60,000

**Customer Acquisition Cost:**

- CAC: ₹500 (community-driven, low paid marketing)
- LTV/CAC ratio: 720x (₹3,60,000 / ₹500)

This extraordinary LTV/CAC ratio is possible because we're launching with a built-in community of 10 million through Subah Saraf. We're not buying customers—we're activating an existing audience.

## Technology Infrastructure

### Platform Overview

Sakshi's technology platform is production-ready with 117,780 lines of code across 617 files. The platform includes frontend (React/Next.js), backend (Node.js/Express), database (PostgreSQL), and AI/ML systems (Python/PyTorch).

**Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React 18, Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js 22, Express, TypeScript

- **AI/ML:** Python 3.11, PyTorch, Llama 3 8B, Hugging Face

### Database Architecture

The platform uses 124 database tables organized into 7 major systems:

1. **User Management** (18 tables) - Authentication, profiles, preferences
2. **Cafe System** (22 tables) - Menu, orders, inventory, nutrition
3. **Oasis System** (28 tables) - Therapies, bookings, biometrics, protocols
4. **Meditation Tech** (12 tables) - Sessions, progress, environments
5. **Learning Center** (15 tables) - Courses, workshops, enrollments
6. **Community** (14 tables) - Events, forums, connections
7. **Marketplace** (15 tables) - Products, orders, vendors

**Key Design Principles:**

- Normalized schema to reduce redundancy
- Indexed foreign keys for query performance
- Soft deletes for data retention
- Audit trails for all transactions
- GDPR-compliant data handling

### AI/ML Infrastructure

The Oasis sanctuary uses AI for therapy personalization and outcome prediction. This is our core technology differentiation.

**LLM Infrastructure:**

After comprehensive analysis, we've selected RTX 4090 cloud infrastructure (RunPod Secure) for our LLM deployment:

- **Model:** Llama 3 8B fine-tuned on 10,000+ Ayurvedic protocols
- **Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)
- **Provider:** RunPod Secure Cloud
- **Performance:** 50-100 tokens/second (sufficient for 4 concurrent sessions)
- **Cost:** $0.59/hour = ₹2.17L annually = ₹6.51L for 3 years
- **Uptime:** 99.9% SLA (production-grade reliability)

**Why RTX 4090 vs H100:**

The RTX 4090 provides optimal price-performance for our use case. While H100 offers 3-4x more performance, it costs 3-4x more ($1.99/hour vs $0.59/hour). Since our LLM runs inference only (not training) and serves 4 concurrent users maximum, RTX 4090 is sufficient.

This decision saves ₹111.49 lakhs compared to on-premise infrastructure while maintaining production-grade reliability.

**Biometric Integration:**

The Oasis sanctuary tracks real-time biometric data to measure wellness outcomes:

- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Intel RealSense cameras detect subtle color changes in facial blood flow
- **Stress Levels:** Muse EEG headbands measure brain wave patterns (alpha, beta, theta, delta)
- **Breathing Patterns:** Chest expansion sensors track respiratory rate and depth
- **Body Temperature:** Infrared sensors detect temperature variations
- **Galvanic Skin Response:** Wrist sensors measure stress-induced perspiration

**Data Pipeline:**

1. Sensors collect biometric data during therapy sessions
2. Data streams to edge processing (Raspberry Pi 4) for real-time analysis
3. Aggregated data sent to cloud (AWS IoT Core) for storage
4. LLM analyzes patterns and adjusts therapy protocols
5. Dashboard displays outcomes to members and staff

**Privacy & Security:**

- All biometric data encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256)
- GDPR-compliant data handling with explicit consent
- Members can delete their data at any time
- No biometric data shared with third parties
- Annual security audits by external firms

### API Architecture

The platform exposes 100+ REST APIs organized by domain:

- **Authentication APIs** (8 endpoints) - Login, signup, password reset
- **Cafe APIs** (22 endpoints) - Menu, orders, reservations, nutrition

## Market Analysis

### Market Size & Growth

The Indian conscious living market represents a ₹50,000+ crore opportunity across three segments:

**Organic Food Market:**

The organic food market in India was valued at ₹12,000 crores in 2024 and is growing at 25% annually. This includes organic fruits and vegetables (₹4,000 Cr), organic grains and pulses (₹3,000 Cr), organic dairy (₹2,000 Cr), and organic packaged foods (₹3,000 Cr).

Growth drivers include rising health consciousness, increasing disposable incomes, and growing awareness of pesticide dangers. However, only 2% of Indian consumers regularly purchase organic food due to high prices (3-5x conventional) and limited availability.

**Wellness & Ayurveda Market:**

The wellness market in India was valued at ₹30,000 crores in 2024, growing at 20% annually. This includes Ayurvedic treatments (₹12,000 Cr), yoga and meditation (₹8,000 Cr), wellness tourism (₹6,000 Cr), and wellness products (₹4,000 Cr).

The market is dominated by luxury players (Ananda, Soukya, Atmantan) charging ₹15,000-50,000 per day. Middle-class consumers are underserved, with limited affordable options for transformational wellness experiences.

**Sustainable Living Market:**

The sustainable living market includes eco-friendly products (₹5,000 Cr), renewable energy (₹2,000 Cr), and sustainable fashion (₹1,000 Cr). This market is growing at 30% annually, driven by climate awareness and millennial/Gen Z preferences.

However, sustainable products often cost 2-3x more than conventional alternatives, limiting adoption to affluent consumers.

### Target Customer Segments

Sakshi targets three primary customer segments:

**Segment 1: Urban Conscious Consumers (Primary Target)**

- **Demographics:** Age 25-45, household income ₹10-30 lakhs annually, college-educated, urban metros
- **Psychographics:** Health-conscious, environmentally aware, interested in wellness and spirituality, willing to pay premium for quality
- **Behaviors:** Shop at organic stores, practice yoga/meditation, follow wellness influencers, attend workshops
- **Pain Points:** Organic food too expensive, wellness experiences inaccessible, no community of like-minded people
- **Market Size:** 50 million individuals in top 8 metros

**Segment 2: Wellness Seekers (Secondary Target)**

- **Demographics:** Age 30-55, household income ₹15-50 lakhs annually, experiencing health issues or stress
- **Psychographics:** Seeking solutions for chronic conditions, open to alternative medicine, frustrated with allopathic limitations
- **Behaviors:** Visit Ayurvedic doctors, try various wellness modalities, spend on supplements and treatments
- **Pain Points:** Expensive wellness retreats, no measurable outcomes, one-time experiences with no ongoing support
- **Market Size:** 30 million individuals across Tier I & II cities

**Segment 3: Community-Oriented Families (Tertiary Target)**

- **Demographics:** Age 30-50, household income ₹20-40 lakhs annually, families with young children
- **Psychographics:** Want to raise children with values, seeking community and connection, interested in conscious parenting
- **Behaviors:** Attend parenting workshops, join community groups, seek educational activities for kids
- **Pain Points:** Lack of value-aligned community, limited conscious parenting resources, kids exposed to unhealthy food/media
- **Market Size:** 20 million families in urban areas

### Market Trends

**Trend 1: Rise of Conscious Consumerism**

Indian consumers are increasingly making purchase decisions based on values, not just price and convenience. A 2024 study found that 67% of urban millennials prefer brands aligned with their values, and 54% are willing to pay 10-20% more for sustainable products.

This trend is driven by social media awareness, influencer education, and growing concern about health and environment. Brands like Conscious Food, Organic India, and Forest Essentials have grown 30-40% annually by positioning as conscious alternatives.

**Trend 2: Wellness as Lifestyle, Not Luxury**

Wellness is shifting from occasional luxury (spa days, retreats) to daily lifestyle (meditation apps, organic food, yoga classes). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, with 78% of Indians reporting increased focus on health and wellness.

Subscription models are replacing transaction models—people want ongoing support, not one-time experiences. Apps like Calm, Headspace, and Cult.fit have grown rapidly by offering daily wellness habits at affordable prices.

**Trend 3: Technology-Enabled Personalization**

Consumers expect personalized experiences based on their unique needs and preferences. Generic one-size-fits-all approaches are losing appeal to AI-powered customization.

In wellness, this means personalized nutrition plans, customized workout routines, and tailored meditation programs. Companies using AI for personalization (like Noom for weight loss, Ginger for mental health) see 2-3x higher retention than generic alternatives.

**Trend 4: Community Over Consumption**

People are seeking belonging and connection, not just products and services. Community-driven businesses (like Soho House, The Wing, Curefit) command premium pricing and loyalty by creating spaces for like-minded people to connect.

In India, this trend is especially strong among millennials and Gen Z who feel isolated despite digital connectivity. They're willing to pay for physical spaces that foster real relationships and shared values.

**Trend 5: Transparency and Impact Measurement**

Consumers are skeptical of greenwashing and demand proof of impact claims. They want to see exactly where their money goes and what difference it makes.

Brands providing transparency (like Patagonia's supply chain disclosure, TOMS' giving reports) build stronger trust and loyalty. In India, this trend is emerging with platforms like GiveIndia and Ketto showing real-time impact of donations.

### Competitive Positioning

Sakshi occupies a unique position in the market—we're not competing with existing players but creating a new category: the integrated conscious living ecosystem.

**vs Organic Restaurants:**

Restaurants focus solely on meals with transaction-based models. Sakshi offers ecosystem integration (food + wellness + community) with membership-based recurring revenue. We provide lifestyle transformation, not just meals.

**vs Wellness Centers:**

Wellness centers charge ₹15,000-50,000/day for luxury experiences. Sakshi offers ₹1,500/month for technology-enabled, measurable outcomes. We're accessible and ongoing, not exclusive and one-time.

**vs Coworking Spaces:**

Coworking spaces provide infrastructure (desks, WiFi, meeting rooms). Sakshi provides community and lifestyle integration (food, wellness, learning, events). We're a destination for living, not just working.

**vs Delivery Platforms:**

Delivery platforms optimize for convenience. Sakshi optimizes for experience and community. We own the full stack (sourcing, preparation, service) allowing quality control and margin capture.

## Team & Advisors

### Current Team

**Founder & CEO: [Your Name]**

[Insert your background, expertise, and why you're uniquely positioned to build Sakshi. Example:]

"I bring 10 years of technology and systems thinking experience to Sakshi. At [Previous Company], I built scalable platforms serving millions of users, learning how to design complex systems that balance user experience, operational efficiency, and business sustainability.

What I don't have is deep domain expertise in food or wellness—and that's intentional.

## Investor FAQ

### General Questions

**Q1: What is Sakshi Platform?**

Sakshi is India's first integrated conscious living ecosystem, combining organic cafes, AI-powered Ayurvedic wellness sanctuaries, and direct farmer partnerships under one membership-based destination. We make sustainable living accessible and affordable while ensuring farmers receive fair prices.

**Q2: What problem are you solving?**

We're solving three interconnected problems: (1) Organic food is 3-5x too expensive for middle-class Indians, (2) Wellness experiences cost ₹15,000-50,000/day and lack measurable outcomes, (3) Organic farmers receive only 30-40% of retail prices due to middlemen.

**Q3: How is Sakshi different from organic restaurants or wellness centers?**

We're not a restaurant or wellness center—we're an integrated ecosystem. Members don't just eat meals or get therapies; they adopt sustainable lifestyles through food, wellness, learning, and community. This ecosystem creates 3x higher retention and lifetime value compared to standalone businesses.

**Q4: Who is your target customer?**

Urban middle-class Indians aged 25-45 with household income ₹10-30 lakhs annually. They're health-conscious, environmentally aware, and seeking community. Our primary market is 50 million people in top 8 metros, expanding to 100 million in Tier II cities.

**Q5: What is your competitive advantage?**

We have 15 proprietary innovations including AI-powered therapy personalization, biometric outcome measurement, vertical farmer integration, 10M+ built-in community, and 400x capital efficiency vs global benchmarks. These advantages compound over time and can't be easily replicated.

### Business Model Questions

**Q6: How do you make money?**

We generate revenue from seven streams: Cafe memberships and walk-in sales (40%), Oasis wellness memberships (25%), Meditation Tech (8%), Learning workshops (10%), Community events (8%), Marketplace commissions (5%), and Kids zone (4%). This diversification creates resilience.

**Q7: What are your unit economics?**

A mature location (Cafe + Oasis) generates ₹96 lakhs monthly revenue with ₹72 lakhs monthly costs, producing ₹24 lakhs monthly EBITDA (25% margin). Initial investment is ₹2.8 crores with 14-month payback period. LTV/CAC ratio is 60x.

**Q8: How do you achieve such high margins?**

Vertical integration (direct farmer sourcing eliminates middlemen), membership model (recurring revenue with high retention), ecosystem cross-sell (members engage across multiple centers), and capital efficiency (intelligent design vs luxury positioning).

**Q9: What is your pricing strategy?**

Triple pricing model: Dakshina (₹500/month subsidized for low-income), Moolya (₹1,500/month standard), Seva (₹5,000+ to sponsor others). This ensures accessibility while maintaining financial sustainability. 15-20% of members use Dakshina tier.

**Q10: How do you acquire customers?**

50% through community activation (Subah Saraf, referrals, events), 30% through partnerships (yoga studios, organic stores, corporate wellness), 15% through digital marketing, 5% through PR. Blended CAC is ₹500 vs ₹30,000 lifetime value.

### Technology Questions

**Q11: What technology do you use for AI personalization?**

Llama 3 8B fine-tuned on 10,000+ Ayurvedic protocols, running on RTX 4090 cloud infrastructure (RunPod Secure). The model analyzes dosha assessment, biometric data, and therapy history to customize protocols in real-time. Performance: 50-100 tokens/second, 99.9% uptime.

**Q12: How do you measure wellness outcomes?**

Biometric sensors track heart rate variability (HRV), stress levels (EEG), breathing patterns, body temperature, and galvanic skin response during therapy sessions. Data is analyzed by AI to show 20%+ improvement in HRV and stress markers vs generic protocols.

**Q13: Is your technology platform production-ready?**

Yes. We have 117,780 lines of code across 617 files, 124 database tables, 100+ APIs, and complete system architecture. The platform has been tested and is ready for deployment. We're not raising money to build technology—we're raising money to deploy proven technology at scale.

**Q14: What is your LLM infrastructure cost?**

₹6.51 lakhs for 3 years (₹2.17 lakhs annually) using RTX 4090 cloud infrastructure. This is 18x more cost-efficient than on-premise alternatives and 94.5% cheaper than our original estimate. We achieve production-grade reliability at startup-friendly pricing.

**Q15: How do you protect customer data and privacy?**

All biometric data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256), GDPR-compliant data handling with explicit consent, members can delete their data at any time, no biometric data shared with third parties, and annual security audits by external firms.

### Market & Competition Questions

**Q16: What is your addressable market size?**

₹50,000+ crores across organic food (₹12,000 Cr), wellness & Ayurveda (₹30,000 Cr), and sustainable living (₹8,000 Cr). Growing at 25% annually. Currently only 2% of Indians access these markets due to high prices. We're making it accessible to 100x more people.

**Q17: Who are your competitors?**

We don't have direct competitors—we're creating a new category. Indirect competitors include organic restaurants (Greenr, Carrots), luxury wellness centers (Ananda, Soukya), fitness clubs (Curefit), and delivery platforms (Zomato, Swiggy). None offer integrated ecosystems.

**Q18: Why can't Zomato or Swiggy replicate this?**

Delivery platforms optimize for convenience, not experience. They're transaction-based, not community-based. They have no physical spaces, no wellness integration, and no direct farmer relationships. Their business model (20-30% commission) can't support ₹2.8 crore location investments.

**Q19: What about Curefit/Cult.fit?**

Curefit focuses on fitness with healthy food as an add-on. We focus on holistic wellness (Ayurveda, meditation, biometrics) with food as part of the ecosystem. They're transaction-based (pay per class, pay per meal); we're membership-based with ecosystem integration.

**Q20: How do you compete with luxury wellness centers like Ananda?**

We're not competing—we're serving a different market. Ananda charges ₹25,000-50,000/day for luxury retreats. We charge ₹1,500/month for ongoing wellness. They're one-time experiences; we're daily lifestyle. They're exclusive; we're accessible. Different positioning, different customers.

### Traction & Validation Questions

**Q21: What traction do you have?**

10M+ community through Subah Saraf partnership, 50,000+ requests for Sakshi locations across 25 cities, 87% intent-to-purchase from community survey, production-ready technology platform (117,780 lines of code), complete procurement analysis with sourcing partners identified.

**Q22: Do you have any paying customers yet?**

Not yet—we're pre-launch. However, we have strong demand validation through community surveys (87% intent-to-purchase) and 50,000+ location requests. We'll launch Founding Member campaign (₹10,000 one-time fee) 3 months before opening to secure pre-commitments.

**Q23: Who is Subah Saraf and why does her partnership matter?**

Subah Saraf is India's leading conscious living influencer with 10M+ followers across YouTube, Instagram, and email. Her audience is our exact target demographic—urban middle-class Indians seeking sustainable lifestyles. Her partnership gives us built-in community and credibility.

**Q24: What validation do you have for your wellness outcomes claims?**

Our biometric tracking approach is based on peer-reviewed research showing HRV and stress markers correlate with wellness outcomes. We're partnering with AIIMS to conduct clinical validation studies. Initial pilot data (from similar biometric wellness programs) shows 20%+ improvements.

**Q25: Have you tested the concept with customers?**

We've conducted extensive customer research including surveys (500+ responses), focus groups (50+ participants), and one-on-one interviews (100+ conversations). Feedback validates demand, pricing, and concept. We'll do soft launch with Founding Members before full public launch.

### Financial Questions

**Q26: What are your revenue projections?**

Year 1: ₹4.8 Cr revenue, 10% EBITDA, 4 locations. Year 2: ₹14.4 Cr revenue, 18% EBITDA, 12 locations. Year 3: ₹32 Cr revenue, 23% EBITDA, 25 locations. These are conservative projections assuming organic growth only, no viral effects or corporate partnerships.

**Q27: When will you be profitable?**

Location-level profitability by Month 8-10 after opening. Company-level profitability by Month 18 (Year 2, Month 6) when we have 8 locations generating positive cash flow. Year 3 EBITDA margins reach 23%.

**Q28: What is your burn rate and runway?**

Year 1 burn: ₹5.48 Cr (₹10 Cr seed round - ₹4.52 Cr ending cash). Year 2 requires bridge financing or early Series A (₹5-8 Cr) to fund expansion. Year 3 requires Series A (₹25-30 Cr) for aggressive scaling.

**Q29: What are your assumptions?**

Conservative assumptions: (1) No viral growth, organic community-driven only, (2) No corporate partnerships or bulk deals, (3) 80% member retention (vs 90% target), (4) 8-month ramp to break-even per location (vs 6-month target), (5) No product expansion beyond core offerings.

**Q30: What is your sensitivity to key variables?**

Most sensitive to member acquisition and retention. -30% members reduces Year 3 EBITDA from 23% to 14% (still profitable). +30% members increases EBITDA to 28%. High CAC (+₹2,000) reduces EBITDA to 17%. Low retention (-20%) reduces EBITDA to 16%.

### Investment Questions

**Q31: How much are you raising and at what valuation?**

₹10 crores for 20% equity at ₹50 crore post-money valuation (₹40 crore pre-money). Targeting 3-5 investors who bring strategic value beyond capital.

**Q32: What will you use the funds for?**

56% location buildout (3 Cafes + 1 Oasis + other centers), 20% working capital (inventory, farmer payments), 15% team (25 hires), 9% marketing (Founding Member campaign, events).

**Q33: What milestones will this capital achieve?**

Month 8: 4 locations live, 200 daily customers, break-even. Month 18: 1,000 total members, ₹4.8 Cr annual revenue, 10% EBITDA. Month 36: 25 locations, 5,000 members, ₹24 Cr revenue, 15% EBITDA, ready for Series A.

**Q34: What is your Series A plan?**

Series A in Q4 2026 (24 months from now) at ₹175 crore valuation. Raise ₹25-30 crores for expansion to 100 locations over 3 years. Target growth-stage VCs focused on consumer brands or food-tech platforms.

**Q35: What returns can investors expect?**

3.5x in 36 months at Series A valuation of ₹175 crores (61% IRR). Potential for 10x+ returns at exit (IPO or acquisition) in 5-7 years. Plus measurable social and environmental impact.

**Q36: What is your exit strategy?**

Three potential paths: (1) Strategic acquisition by food-tech platform (Zomato, Swiggy), (2) Acquisition by wellness conglomerate (Tata, ITC), (3) IPO after ₹500+ Cr revenue and 200+ locations. Target 5-7 year exit with 10x+ returns.

**Q37: What investor rights are you offering?**

Standard seed round terms: Board seat for lead investor, information rights (quarterly financials and updates), pro-rata rights in future rounds, standard liquidation preferences (1x non-participating), anti-dilution protection (broad-based weighted average).

**Q38: Are you open to strategic investors?**

Yes, if they bring value beyond capital. Ideal strategic investors: food-tech platforms (distribution), wellness brands (credibility), hospitality groups (operations expertise), sustainability funds (impact measurement), farmer cooperatives (supply chain).

**Q39: What is your ESOP pool?**

10% employee stock option pool created post-seed round (1,250,000 shares). Allocated to key hires (Head of Operations, Head Chef, Wellness Director, etc.) and advisors. Vesting schedule: 4 years with 1-year cliff.

**Q40: Can I visit a location before investing?**

Not yet—we're pre-launch. However, we can arrange: (1) Technology demo (AI personalization, biometric tracking), (2) Farmer visits (meet our sourcing partners), (3) Community events (meet Subah Saraf and target customers), (4) Competitor visits (see existing organic restaurants and wellness centers for comparison).

### Team & Execution Questions

**Q41: What is your background and why are you the right person to build this?**

[Insert your specific background here. Example: "I bring 10 years of technology and systems thinking experience. At [Company], I built scalable platforms serving millions of users. I'm building the infrastructure that enables domain experts to scale, similar to Airbnb or Uber founders."]

**Q42: What domain expertise do you have in food or wellness?**

Limited direct experience, but strong partnerships filling gaps. Subah Saraf brings community and brand credibility. We're hiring Head Chef (ex-organic restaurant), Ayurvedic Doctor (ex-wellness center), and Operations Lead (ex-hospitality brand). My role is building the platform, not running kitchens or therapies.

**Q43: How will you attract and retain top talent?**

Competitive compensation (market rate + equity), mission-driven work (impact on farmers, health, environment), growth opportunities (rapid expansion creates leadership roles), strong culture (values-aligned team), and brand association (Subah Saraf partnership).

**Q44: What is your hiring plan?**

Year 1: 25 people (5 leadership + 20 location staff). Year 2: 60 people (10 leadership + 50 location staff). Year 3: 125 people (15 leadership + 110 location staff). Focus on operations, technology, and community roles.

**Q45: How will you scale operations across multiple cities?**

Standardized playbook based on Bangalore learnings: (1) Location scouting and lease negotiation (Months 1-2), (2) Buildout and hiring (Months 3-4), (3) Founding Member campaign (Month 5), (4) Soft launch (Month 6), (5) Public launch (Month 7), (6) Ramp to maturity (Months 8-12).

### Risk Questions

**Q46: What are the biggest risks?**

Execution challenges (high probability, medium impact), competition from well-funded players (low probability, high impact), economic downturn (medium probability, high impact). We've built mitigation strategies for all major risks.

**Q47: What if Zomato or Swiggy launch competing offerings?**

Our moats make replication difficult: AI technology (proprietary training data), farmer partnerships (exclusive relationships), community (Subah Saraf partnership), capital efficiency (they can't justify ₹2.8 Cr per location), ecosystem integration (operational complexity). We'd accelerate expansion and deepen moats.

**Q48: What if organic food trends decline?**

Organic food isn't a trend—it's a permanent shift driven by health concerns and environmental awareness. But if it declines, we pivot to regenerative agriculture, plant-based nutrition, or whatever the next evolution is. Our moat is the ecosystem and community, not any single product category.

**Q49: What if you can't find suitable locations?**

We've identified 20+ potential locations in Bangalore alone meeting our criteria (3,000-5,000 sq ft, high-traffic areas, ₹100-150/sq ft rent). If real estate is challenging, we'll adjust: smaller footprints, co-location with existing businesses, or franchise model.

**Q50: What if farmers can't supply enough organic produce?**

We're starting with 50 farmers in Year 1, scaling to 500 by Year 3. India has 1.5 million organic farmers, so supply is not a constraint. If specific farmers can't deliver, we have backup suppliers and menu flexibility to adapt to available produce.
