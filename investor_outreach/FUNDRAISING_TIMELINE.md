## Negotiation Strategy

### Key Terms to Negotiate

**1. Valuation**
- **Target:** ₹50 crores post-money (₹40 crores pre-money)
- **Range:** ₹40-60 crores post-money (willing to flex based on investor quality)
- **Rationale:** Comparable seed rounds for food-tech/wellness startups with similar traction

**2. Board Composition**
- **Target:** 3-person board (Founder, Lead Investor, Independent Director)
- **Range:** Willing to add second investor board seat if they bring significant strategic value
- **Rationale:** Maintain founder control while giving investors governance rights

**3. Liquidation Preference**
- **Target:** 1x non-participating preferred
- **Range:** Willing to accept 1x participating if valuation is favorable
- **Rationale:** Standard seed round terms, protects investors while aligning incentives

**4. Anti-Dilution Protection**
- **Target:** Broad-based weighted average
- **Range:** Not willing to accept full ratchet (too founder-unfriendly)
- **Rationale:** Standard seed round terms, protects investors from down rounds

**5. Pro-Rata Rights**
- **Target:** Pro-rata rights for all seed investors
- **Range:** Willing to give super pro-rata to lead investor
- **Rationale:** Allows investors to maintain ownership in future rounds

**6. Information Rights**
- **Target:** Quarterly financials and annual audited statements
- **Range:** Willing to provide monthly financials if investors request
- **Rationale:** Transparency builds trust, not burdensome to provide

**7. Vesting**
- **Target:** No founder vesting (already built the product)
- **Range:** Willing to accept 1-year cliff if investors insist
- **Rationale:** Founder has already invested significant time and capital

### Negotiation Tactics

**Tactic 1: Create Competitive Dynamics**

Don't negotiate with one investor in isolation. Share that you have multiple term sheets and are evaluating options. This creates urgency and prevents low-ball offers.

**Example:** "We've received three term sheets and are comparing terms. We're looking for investors who bring strategic value beyond capital, not just the highest valuation."

**Tactic 2: Focus on Strategic Value**

Emphasize that you're choosing investors based on strategic fit, not just terms. This allows you to accept slightly lower valuations from preferred investors without losing face.

**Example:** "Your expertise in [area] and portfolio company introductions are worth more to us than a 10% higher valuation from a purely financial investor."

**Tactic 3: Bundle Terms**

Don't negotiate terms one by one. Bundle them together so you can trade off (e.g., accept lower valuation in exchange for better board composition).

**Example:** "We're willing to accept ₹45 crore post-money if we can maintain a 3-person board with only one investor seat."

**Tactic 4: Use "Market Standard" Language**

Frame your positions as "market standard" rather than personal preferences. This makes them harder to negotiate away.

**Example:** "1x non-participating liquidation preference is market standard for seed rounds. We're not comfortable with participating preferred as it misaligns incentives."

**Tactic 5: Know Your Walk-Away Point**

Decide in advance what terms are non-negotiable. Be willing to walk away if investors push too hard.

**Example:** "We need to maintain at least 75% founder ownership post-seed to have meaningful equity for future rounds and team hires. Below that, we'd rather raise less capital or wait for better terms."

- Leverage Subah Saraf's network for additional warm introductions
- Improve email copy based on A/B testing
- Engage on social media to build relationships before outreach

### Risk 2: Investors Want Lower Valuation

- Show comparable seed rounds for similar companies
- Create competitive dynamics with multiple term sheets
- Be willing to raise less capital (₹7-8 Cr) at target valuation

### Risk 3: Due Diligence Uncovers Concerns

**Mitigation:**

- Provide comprehensive due diligence package upfront
- Have expert advisors available to address technical questions

### Risk 4: Fundraise Takes Longer Than Expected

**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach immediately (don't wait for "perfect" materials)
- Maintain financial runway (reduce burn if needed)

- Be willing to adjust timeline and expectations

### Risk 5: Term Sheet Terms Are Unfavorable

**Mitigation:**
- Educate yourself on market standard terms before negotiating
- Engage experienced legal counsel for term sheet review
- Be willing to walk away from bad terms
- Focus on strategic value, not just valuation

## Conclusion

Raising ₹10 crores in 12 weeks is ambitious but achievable with disciplined execution, strong materials, and compelling traction. This roadmap provides a structured approach to maximize success probability.

**Key Success Factors:**

1. **Preparation:** Finalize all materials before outreach (deck, financials, due diligence package)
2. **Parallel Processing:** Engage multiple investors simultaneously to create urgency
3. **Momentum:** Share weekly traction updates to demonstrate progress
4. **Strategic Selectivity:** Choose investors who bring value beyond capital

Fundraising is a full-time job. Block your calendar for investor meetings, due diligence calls, and follow-ups. Delegate other responsibilities to team members or advisors. Stay focused on the goal: close ₹10 crores with 3-5 strategic investors who will help you build Sakshi into a generational company.

**You've built something extraordinary. Now go raise the capital to bring it to life.**
