# SAKSHI PLATFORM: ADMIN GUIDE

**Welcome, Administrator!** This guide provides an overview of the admin dashboard and how to manage the Sakshi AI Platform.

## 1. Admin Dashboard Overview

Your admin dashboard is the central hub for managing all aspects of the platform. It includes:

- **Key Metrics:** At-a-glance view of sales, donations, user sign-ups, and event registrations.
- **Recent Activity:** A live feed of the latest actions on the platform.
- **Navigation:** Easy access to all management sections.

## 2. Product Management

- **View Products:** See a complete list of all products in your inventory.
- **Search & Filter:** Quickly find products by name, category, status, or donation ID.
- **Edit Products:** Update product details, pricing, images, and descriptions.
- **Create Products:** Manually add new products to the inventory.

## 3. Donation Processing

This is a critical workflow for our circular economy model.

### Step 1: Review Pending Donations
- Go to the "Donations" section to see all items waiting for review.
- Examine the photos and descriptions provided by the donor.

### Step 2: Approve or Reject
- **Approve:** If the item meets our quality standards, approve the donation. The donor will automatically receive Seva Tokens.
- **Reject:** If the item is not suitable, reject the donation and provide a brief reason.

### Step 3: Create Product from Donation
- Once a donation is approved, you can create a product listing from it.
- Fill in the product details (category, condition, pricing).
- The product will then be live on the platform.
