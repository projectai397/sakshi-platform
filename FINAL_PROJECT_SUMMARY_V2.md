## 4. SakshiChain: The Future of Resale

SakshiChain is the platform's most innovative feature, bringing the power of Web3 to the circular economy. It consists of two core components:

### 4.1. Digital Product Passports (DPPs)

Every item listed on the platform is given a unique Digital Product Passport, which is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on the Polygon blockchain. The DPP serves as an immutable record of the product's entire lifecycle.

-   **Authenticity & Provenance:** Tracks the item's original brand, material, and ownership history, eliminating counterfeits.
-   **Lifecycle Tracking:** Records every repair, alteration, or upcycling event, adding value and transparency.
-   **Impact Measurement:** The DPP calculates and displays the positive environmental impact of the item, such as CO2 and water saved.

### 4.2. SakshiCoin (SAK)

SakshiCoin is an ERC20 utility token that powers the platform's rewards economy. Users earn SAK for actions that contribute to the circular economy and the community.

-   **Earning SAK:** Users are rewarded for quality listings, repairing items, writing helpful reviews, and referring new members.
-   **Spending SAK:** SAK can be used for discounts on purchases, access to exclusive items, or to vote on community governance proposals.
-   **Staking & Governance:** Users can stake their SAK to earn additional rewards and participate in the platform's decision-making process.
