## Presentation 1: Investor Pitch Deck

### Slide 1: Title
**Sakshi Platform**
Conscious Living Made Accessible
Transforming Sustainability into a Lifestyle

### Slide 2: The Problem
**The Sustainability Gap is Widening**

Despite growing awareness, sustainable living remains inaccessible to most Indians:
- Healthy food costs 40-60% more than conventional options
- 68% of Indians want to live sustainably but cite cost as the primary barrier
- ₹92,000 crores worth of usable goods end up in landfills annually
- Urban food waste: 50 kg per person per year
- Only 12% of Indians have access to organic food markets

The current system forces people to choose between their values and their budget.

### Slide 3: Our Solution
**Sakshi: A Comprehensive Conscious Living Ecosystem**

We've built an integrated platform that makes sustainable living accessible and affordable through:

**Sakshi Cafe** - Plant-based food with triple pricing (Community/Fair/Supporter)
**Thrift Marketplace** - Quality pre-loved items with pay-what-you-can model
**Repair Cafe** - Community repair events preventing waste
**Swap Events** - Money-free exchange marketplace
**Upcycle Studio** - Creative sustainability workshops
**Seva Token Economy** - Reward participation, not just purchases

One platform. Multiple pathways. Universal access.

### Slide 4: Market Opportunity

**Organic Food Market**: ₹1.2 trillion by 2027 (18% CAGR)

### Slide 5: Business Model

3. Vendor Subscriptions - 8% of revenue
4. Cooking Classes & Workshops - 7% of revenue
5. Franchise Fees - 5% of revenue

**Unit Economics** (per cafe location):

- Monthly Orders: 3,000
- Monthly Revenue: ₹10.5 lakhs

**Projected Revenue**:

### Slide 6: Triple Pricing Innovation
**Industry-First Pricing Model Ensuring Universal Access**

**How It Works**:
- **Community Tier** (30% of customers): Pay what they can afford (₹50-150)
- **Fair Tier** (50% of customers): Pay fair market price (₹200-300)
- **Supporter Tier** (20% of customers): Pay premium to support community (₹350-500)

**Why It Works**:
- Self-regulating: No verification needed, trust-based
- Financially sustainable: Supporter tier subsidizes community tier
